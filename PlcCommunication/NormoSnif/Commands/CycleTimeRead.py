    Initializes the PCâ€™s cycle time history or reads the average, max., and min. cycle time.\n

    00: Initializes the cycle time.\n
    01: Reads the average, maximum, and minimum cycle time.\n
    Average cycle time, max. cycle time, min. cycle time (response): Each value is expressed in 8-digit BCD in

    The average cycle time is obtained as follows:\n
